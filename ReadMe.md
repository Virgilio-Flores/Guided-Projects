## Project 1: Data Analysis

In this project, I explore and analyze a traffic volume dataset to practice data visualization and analysis.

## Project 2: Data Engineering

MapReduce Paradigm: This project puts mapreduce into practice to prepare one for big data tasks in the future.

## Project 3: Data Engineering

Similar to Project 2, this is a data engineering task where data taken from Yahoo Finance is preprocessed and filtered.

## Project 4: Data Analysis

A project focused on honing the data cleaning skills like combining datasets from different sources and figuring out how to best merge the data.
